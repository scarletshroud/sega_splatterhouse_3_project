# Splatterhouse 3 Sega Mega Drive

An attempt to recreate a piece of the Splatterhouse 3 game compatible with Sega Mega Drive Console 16 bit.

## Let's have a look! 

Here are a few screenshots of my demo game.

Main Game

So, all the main mechanics of the game work (of course, there are some issues):
  - Basic Game State Engine
  - Controls
  - Player logic
  - Enemy logic
  - Map scrolling
  - HUD
  - Animations
  - Sounds

## Launching
1. Download rom.bin
2. Download Sega emulator (Kega Fusion or Gens)
3. Open the rom through the emulator

The SGDK was used for development of the game.
